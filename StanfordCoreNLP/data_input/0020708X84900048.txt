In order to establish a system of monitoring radioactivity in waste water treatment plants, the optimum geometry of a large-volume Marinelli-type vessel with an 8% Ge(Li) detector was investigated, but optimum volume was not obtained. However, at a particular volume, the optimum geometry existed. The 30 L Marinelli-type vessel was applied to a system monitoring the influent and the return sludge at a waste water treatment plant in Tokyo.
