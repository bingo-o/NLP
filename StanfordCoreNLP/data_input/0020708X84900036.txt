The effect of 25 and 50 kGy Î³-radiotion doses on ampicillin sodium and two ampicillin esters, pivampicilin and talampicillin, has been assessed by different chemical and microbiological analytical techniques. All compounds undergo significant radiolysis at these doses, although lower doses may be practicable for decontamination purposes.
