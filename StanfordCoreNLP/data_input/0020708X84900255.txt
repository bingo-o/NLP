Calculation of the radiation dose at the cellular level is given for several radionuclides that appear promising for radioimmunotherapy using the radiation dose distribution from a point source. The radionuclides have half-lives in the 1â€“3 day range and have electron ranges up to several hundred micrometers. The investigation emphasizes the physical considerations in radionuclide choice for the radiolabeling of monoclonal antibodies or antibody fragments.
