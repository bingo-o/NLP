For steady-current type electron accelerators with single-beam scanning, a fundamental formula is obtained for the relation between the longitudinal dose non-uniformity with simultaneous product movement and beam scanning and with several irradiation parameters. Based on the relation, the critical velocity of the product necessary for the dose uniformity is given by the product of scan frequency, the distance from beam window to product surface, and the square root of the total mean squared scattering angle.
