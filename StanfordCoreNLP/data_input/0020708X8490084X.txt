A high resolution Î³ spectrometric method which uses a single standard in radioactive equilibrium has been found to give reliable values of Ra/U ratio in ores. The method uses the counts at the 186 keV peak region and relative to those of the standard calculates the Ra/U ratio. The procedure has been tested using several standard ores and some local samples in known equilibrium conditions. The results agreed with the reported values within the experimental error limits.
