The effect of void distributions on void fraction determination in two-phase-flow systems employing the radiation attenuation technique is discussed. For a homogeneous or uniform void distribution across the beam, there is no effect on the deduced void fraction. However when the distribution is non-uniform, there is an uncertainty in the result which increases with the degree of non-uniformity and, in some systems, with the width of the beam. It also increases with some physical properties of the systems.
