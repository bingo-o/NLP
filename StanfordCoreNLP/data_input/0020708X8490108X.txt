The distribution of tritium on the surface layer of neutron-irradiated LiF was studied by means of autoradiography. The autoradiographs were compared with microphotographs of the surfaces which were chemically etched after the autoradiographs had been taken. Temperature-programmed desorption of tritium and u.v. absorption spectra were studied on the same sample. Many sharp lines appeared in the autoradiograph. Some of these lines are observed in the microphotograph, but some of them appeared only when the surface was etched. It was concluded from these results that tritium accumulates preferentially on step-edges and dislocations of the surface.
