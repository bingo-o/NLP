From the transmitted spectra of point sources it is concluded that in a medium of low effective atomic number, a multiple-scatter peak is observed at an energy below 100 keV where Compton collisions are not very effective in energy-degradation and photoelectric cross-section is negligible. The energy of the peak does not depend on the thickness and physical state of the medium, or on the primary photon energy. The intensity of the peak decreases exponentially with the thickness of the medium. Measured build-up factors are compared with the calculated ones available in the literature.
